Git repo for Deep Learning AT3


key workflow steps: 

* `Clone` to start using the git repo and make a local copy 
* `Pull` before you start your work, do this often and always before you start your work
* `Add` and `Commit` after you finish your changes, preferably small changes at a time
* `Push` to upload your changes to the git repo 

try to avoid having to `merge` code, but even if you end up need to merge changes, it is not that hard. ping me if you are stuck.

best for each us to work in their own directory, /user/mutaz for me, to avoid conflicts and merge issues.
